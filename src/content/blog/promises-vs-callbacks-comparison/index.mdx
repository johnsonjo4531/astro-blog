  So you've heard about promises well what's
  the major advantage of them compared to callbacks.
  It might seem there isn't any huge advantage to them
  at least at first glance but there are some properties of
  promises that aren't true of at least some or all callbacks
  which make them a handy tool to use in your JavaScript tool belt.

tldr: Promises have alot of interesting properties that make them
useful for wrapping a singular value at some given point in time
giving them some advantages over callbacks for async programming.

So you've heard about [promises][promises], well what's
the major advantage of them compared to callbacks.
It might seem there isn't any huge advantage to them
atleast at first glance but there are some properties of
promises that aren't true of atleast some or most callback patterns.
Just having the guarentees that a Promise will always behave
the same in ways that a callback might not
makes promises a handy tool to use for single values that come
over at any given point in time.

Now, promises aren't really a complete replacement for callbacks either.
Really it's an apple and oranges kind of comparison. Now this is because
for the most part callbacks are alot more general and have a lot more properties
than promises. So, this is to say that pretty much Promises are kind of a special
case of a callback pattern. In fact with your keen eyes you may have noticed that
all promises use callbacks in the first place.

So, why even use promises at all if they are in the whole less powerful? Well, 
in software engineering having a smaller API surface and a smaller range of
possibilities believe it or not is actually a good thing for the most part.
Why? Because, you can make more guarantees about your program. You can also
get additional features, because of the guarantees made and because by narrowing your focus and focusing on the smaller
API surface and building off of it (like make little utility functions and such).

As an example, this might be the reason you see people going with typed languages (like TypeScript, Haskell, C#, Go, or Java maybe) over largely
untyped languages (like JavaScript and Python). You may say you love being able to define any type
possible for your functions and it makes it so easy to just code and forget about the compiler throwing errors.
But, as things change and as your project grows you may want those guarantees.

Honestly, callbacks were something that took me a long time to properly grok, and I found my self asking questions like
how would I make my own callback taking functions like map and reduce or filter. Thanks to resources like this one which is a [list of interactive exercises on functional JS by Jafar Husain](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/)
I was able to make a lot better grasp of how powerful callbacks really are.

Reading things like [Kriskowal's General Theory of Reactivity (GTOR)](https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor) will give you a better understanding of where different primitives of async programming come in, such as promises.

I have an overview of how callbacks fulfill all of these axes or atleast can be used to handle all of them in my post [Callbacks as handling both Spatial and Temporal as well as Singular and Plural Axes](./callbacks-spatial-temporal-and-singular-plural)



1. A promise always has a .then that accepts a callback function.
2. A promise always has a .catch that accepts a callback function
   and acts like a `catch` block from a `try`/`catch`.
3. A promise always has a .finally which acts as a `finally` block
   from a `try`/`catch`/`finally`.
4. You can `await` a promise using async functions.
5. You have utilities builtin to JavaScript at your disposal when
   working with promises.

## 1. .then methods

`.then` is a method that fires your callback once a promise is resolved (finished). This com

## 2. .catch methods

`catch` methods and error handling with Promises is probably its biggest
advantage over callbacks. So, how do you handle errors in callbacks.

```js codesandbox=vanilla
function myCallbackTakingFunction(cb) {
  setTimeout(cb, 3000);
}
```

## 5. JavaScript Builtin Utilities

You have utilities builtin to JavaScript at your disposal when working with promises which at the moment are:

### Promise.all:

`Promise.all` allows you to await several Promises concurrently.
Notice how this means the below code executes in the time
of the longest timeout and not the addition of all the timeouts:

```js codesandbox=vanilla
const timeout = ms => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms));
(async () => {
  const time = Date.now();
  await Promise.all([timeout(1000), timeout(3000), timeout(2500)]);
  console.log(`Executed in ${Date.now() - time}ms`);
})();
```

Which is as opposed to something like the following which runs sequentially. Notice
how the time this takes to complete is the sum of all timeouts.

```js codesandbox=vanilla
const timeout = ms => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms));
(async () => {
  const time = Date.now();
  await timeout(1000);
  await timeout(3000);
  await timeout(2500);
  console.log(`Executed in ${Date.now() - time}ms`);
})();
```

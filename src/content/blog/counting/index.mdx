description: >
    Well you start with 1..2..3..4 and you'll be a pro in no time haha just kidding. So you want to learn how to count really large things.
    Maybe things that you wouldn't otherwise think would be all that easy to count. Maybe things that seem impossible to
    count.

Well you start with 1..2..3..4 and you'll be a pro in no time haha just kidding. So you want to learn how to count really large things.
Maybe things that you wouldn't otherwise think would be all that easy to count. Maybe things that seem impossible to
count.

Well there's a well known xkcd about software development and I think it applies well to combinatorics as well:

![XKCD tasks](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png)

So, it is with combinatorics it can be hard to differentiate for the casual observer on the street what exactly is
easy and what exactly is not easy or possibly even close to if not impossible to count.

But, with a few tools under your belt you will be counting like a pro in no time.

Why don't we start our journey with the [Multiplicative Principle of Combinatorics](./multiplicative-principle).

* No guarantees that you'll be a pro (I don't profess to be a pro myself just a hobbyist), 
but you may just start your journey to professional here in this series of blog posts.

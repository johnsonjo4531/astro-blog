I remember learning all these three concepts back in my High School Computer Science class, but
over time I have come to see a bit more about them.

A solved game is one in which the outcome is known from the beggining win, lose, or draw as long as the players are playing optimally.

Say we have the classic game of Nim although a simplified version of it. Where you have
some number of objects and your target is either to take the last item or to not take it, but on the condition
that you can only take so many stones per round like 1,2,3, or 4. In this case
we'll say you lose if you take the last item and that you win if you do not take the last item.

We can visualize our objects as stones (we'll represent with o's and in groups of 5).

For example here's 20 stones. If you're given the option of only taking 1,2,3 or 4 of them each round
how would you play, is this a solved game,?

Here's an example game

```
START ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo o
P1 ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo (takes 1 stone)
P2 ooooo ooooo ooooo o (takes 4 stones)
P1 ooooo ooooo oo (takes 4 stones)
P2 ooooo ooooo o (takes 1 stones)
P1 ooooo ooo (takes 3 stones)
P2 ooooo o (takes 2 stones)
P1 oooo (takes 2 stones)
P2 o (takes 3 stones)
P1 LOSES!
```

Now I'm about to give away the solution to this slightly simpler nim variant, but
a few things to think about if you want to try and answer it yourself. The last thing you need to know
is in a solved game there is such a thing as a poison position. Basically this means if you start or at any point land 
at this position then you will be guaranteed to lose no matter what you do so long as your opponent knows the optimal strategy.

Before I get to the answer some questions you can ask yourself when playing a game like this are:

Will this game end if both players keep taking turns?

hint: 

>! A case where it won't: if both players could somehow continue infinitely then it could end in a stalemate.

Will it have a guaranteed winner?

hint:

>! A few cases where there won't be a guarenteed winner: 
> the game never ends
> or there is no guaranteed path to victory (the latter is kind of shown with the next question)

What are the poison positions and can they be forced?

Small hint:

>! Think small first. What is the first poison position (the first position you are guaranteed to lose at) 
> and how can you force someone into it from a non poison position. Given that you were able to force someone into
> a poison position at some point as soon as you can no longer force someone
> into a position you may just be at the next poison position.

Larger hint:

>! The first player above started in a poison position can you see how the second player was able to keep them
> in another poison position everytime.

## Will this game end?

Yes, it will definitely end since both players must take a number greater than 0 and the pot is finite.
There will eventually be no more stones.

## Will it have a guaranteed winner?

Yes since the game ends and there is one loser it will have a guaranteed winner.

## What are the poison positions and can they be forced?

Start with the first poison position:


Exhibit A:
```
o
```

**Exhibit A is a poison position.**

Do you see how if you started there you would lose (remember losing is taking the last stone).

If we start in any of the following positions can we force our opponent to enter the above position?

Exhibit B:
```
oo
ooo
oooo
ooooo
```

**All positions in Exhibit B are non-poison positions.**

The answer is yes, and that means none of the above are poison positions, but what about this next one.
Can you force your opponent to enter the single stone position from it?

Exhibit C: 
```
ooooo o
```

**Exhibit C is a poison position.**

No, you cannot in fact starting from Exhibit C anywhere you go will end your opponent somewhere in
Exhibit B which means they can get you to the single stone position in Exhibit A (meaning they'll end up winning). Which means it is decided
that your opponent can always win and you will always lose if you start in this position.

Now we need to find the next poison position. I'll give you an explanation to find it.
If our opponent starts their turn at Exhibit C and we have one additional stone
than at Exhibit C then we just need to take that one stone now we can extend
that to two, three, or four additional stones. Now think if there are five additional stones
from Exhibit C can we force them back to Exhibit C. The answer is no. Can they win after you take
your turn from the position 5 stones away from Exhibit c. The answer there is yes. If you don't
get why stop and try to convince yourself of why.

Are you starting to see a pattern yet of the poison positions.

Remember these are the first few.

```
o
ooooo o
```

And here are the next poison positions.

```
ooooo ooooo o
ooooo ooooo ooooo o
ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo o
ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo o
```

Now do you see the pattern if there is a solo dangling stone not in a group then you'll
lose. Of course these groups are just grouped however I decided to group them, so there's
more to it than just that.

Now what if you wanted to know an arbitrarily large poison number like say for example you had the following question.

Which of these is a poison position in the above nim game rules: 64 stones, 65 stones, 66 stones, 67 stones, 68 stones?

One of them is, and the answer can be given by thinking about when an arbitrarily picked number $n$ is a poison position:

Well how can we determine if an arbitrary $n$ would be a poison number/position. I'll give you a hint it has to do with the number $n$ and it's remainder
once it's divided by 5. 

Hint: (a more clearly worded version of the question using the above hint): 

>! After dividing by 5. What remainder of $n$: 0,1,2,3,4 will leave us with the above poison positions and all others?

<div style={{height: '100vh', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}>Scroll down for answer</div>

66 stones.

Why? Because 66's remainder when dividing by 5 is 1. Why is the number 5 so special in this game,
and why is the remainder one significant?

The number 5 is special, because any one combination of moves the first player takes of taking away stones given the ability to take 
1,2,3,4 can always add up to 5 after player two chooses their stones.

For example:

If player one takes 1 player two can take 4, and $1+4=5$.  
If player one takes 2 player two can take 3, and $2+3=5$.  
If player one takes 3 player two can take 2, and $3+2=5$.  
If player one takes 4 player two can take 1, and $4+1=5$.  

Either player can always **force** the game to be exactly five less stones on the other player's next turn than it was last turn.

Why is remainder 1 special, well 1 is the first poison position number and given that either player can reduce the number by 5 that's
where the remainder comes in of 5.

Reading up on remainders and modular arithmetic probably even just the wiki page will give you the knowledge to understand that last bit.
If it doesn't make sense just remember any remainder minus the number it's being divided by will always have the same remainder i.e. the 
remainder of 16 divided by 5 is 1 and so is 11, 6, and 1 itself (notice those all decremented by 5 and that the divisor was 5).

So, what if we had a different stone picking game where instead of taking 1,2,3,4 stones we could pick it was
something like 1,2,3 that we could pick.

Well, we would end up using the same method all numbers 1,2,3 can add up to 4 by the end of two turns
thus we'll see that we need $n$ to have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 for it to be a poison position.

So, one last example what if we changed it so we again take as we originally did 1,2,3,4 stones, but in order
to win you want to take the last pebble. How would that change
what the poison numbers are?

Well, it would make it so the first poison position would be 5 which means that anywhere where you start you turn
with $n$ having remainder 0 when divided by 5 then you would lose.

Now, that might seem somewhat counter-intuitive for example you might say, but 0 is a winning position for me, but
that's only if you ended your turn there and not if you started it there.

I hope you enjoyed this somewhat lengthy journey through learning about solved games and poison numbers all through a game
of nim.

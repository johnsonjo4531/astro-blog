  This was a maze generating and solving game I made for my Game Development class.
  Jamis Buck the author of Mazes for Programmers and a Ruby on Rails contributor came to my
  game dev class just to talk about mazes and how we could use different algorithms to do
  things such as generating procedurally a 2D over-world map which always has certain properties
  that different maze algorithms have such as always having a path between two points.

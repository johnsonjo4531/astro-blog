  Warning: There's quite a few bugs in this one (can't remember if I added the bugs after or not), but I built this project with some friends from University during a MLH competition at USU. It is
  a collaborative sketching app that uses a node server and socket.io. It was pretty fun to build, we started in the evening and I believe we went until the next evening when we finally stopped
  working on it.

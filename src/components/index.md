## About Me

In my spare time I like to learn programming and dabble in math üòù.  
I love web development. I'm married to a beautiful, wonderful, and supportive wife.
I studied and graduated in computer-science at Utah State University. I loved school and I love my dayjob. I cofound a startup.
I'm a full stack web developer.


### Tech Stacks

### Work

My favorite stack, and what I use at work is:

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL (via TypeGraphQL)
- MongoDB (via Typegoose)

I love this stack because it's flexible and pretty typesafe.

#### This Blog

- Astro

It's starting to grow on me. My last platform was Gatsby and
although I miss the GraphQL part I do not miss the configuration
that came along with Gatsby. It's a very good platform don't get
me wrong. It just was a little hard to fix all the issues when
things went wrong. I like how Astro allows me to import Markdown
easily and it comes with great type safety (strictest settings FTW!)
